            my portfolio and the most basic example of a web page. All that is here is built
            using HTML and CSS only.</p>

            <p>HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update 
                and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the 
                language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the 
                language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and 
                devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain 
                backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 
                but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
                <br><br>
                HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; 
                it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces 
                markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications. For 
                the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because 
                it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.

            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation 
                of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology 
                of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                <br><br>
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, 
                and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and 
                control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share 
                formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and 
                repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the 
                page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                <br><br>
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in 
                different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via 
                speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for 
                alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
